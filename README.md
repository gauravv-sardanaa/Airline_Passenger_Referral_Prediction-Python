# Airline_Passenger_Referral_Prediction-Python
Machine learning project to predict airline passenger referral likelihood. Includes Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), feature engineering and classification models with performance evaluation.

# Introduction
Airline passenger referral prediction is a pivotal aspect in optimizing airline operations and enhancing customer experience. By leveraging predictive analytics, airlines can anticipate and understand passenger behavior, facilitating targeted marketing strategies and personalized services. Referral prediction entails analyzing various factors such as travel history, booking patterns, demographic information, and social interactions to forecast the likelihood of passengers referring the airline to others. This predictive insight enables airlines to tailor their services, loyalty programs, and promotional offers, ultimately fostering customer loyalty and increasing brand advocacy. In an industry where customer satisfaction and loyalty are paramount, effective referral prediction plays a crucial role in driving revenue growth and sustaining competitive advantage.

# Objective
The Airline Passenger Referral Prediction project aimed to analyze and predict passenger referral behavior, with the overarching goal of understanding referral trends, identifying key features influencing referrals.

# Python Libraries used
**Data Wrangling and Manipulation**

Numpy and Pandas

**Visualization**

Matplotlib and Seaborn

**Machine Learning Models**

Sklearn

**Others**

Warnings,NLTK,Spacy,String,Re

# Models
In this project I am implementing 2 machine learning algorithms to predict the target variable and also I have applied optimization techniques to get the best resulting recall.

**Following models have been used for predictions:-**

Logistic Regression Classifier and Random Forest Classifier, along with Hyperparameter tuning and Cross-Validation techniques.

# Notable Findings
I have noticed that Logistic Regression is the stand out performer among other models with a recall of 0.97.Hence, it's safe to say that Logistic Regression Classifier provide a optimal solution to our problem.
